# AirBnb's Strategy for Non-Optimal Listings
AirBnb's Property Supply Dept needs to analyze the characteristics of listings whose revenue is not optimal so that the 'targeted ads program' strategy can be implemented more effectively and focused.

* Airbnb 2024 Strategy: One of the pillars of Airbnb's 2024 strategy is "Making Hosting Mainstream" which focuses on creating a perception among property owners (hosts) that hosting on Airbnb is fun and easy. The objectives of this strategy pillar are to Promote Hosting and highlight the Benefits and Support for Hosts.

* Strategic Initiative of Property Supply Dept:#
The Property Supply Dept aims to realize this strategy by carrying out revenue optimization through a 'targeted ads program' on listings whose revenue is not yet optimal.

* Key Questions & Goal Settings
1. What is the minimum value of `remaining_potential_revenue` used to identify non-optimal and optimal listings? -> Use parameters in descriptive statistics to determine the minimum value of `remaining_potential_revenue`
2. How many and what listings are not optimal? -> Identify the number of listings that are not optimal
3. What are the characteristics of listings that are not optimal based on the offering scheme? -> EDA to generate insights on the characteristics of offering schemes for listings that are not yet optimal based on `room_type` & `minimum_nights`
4. What are the characteristics of listings that are not optimal based on visitor engagement? -> EDA to generate insights on visitor engagement characteristics on listings that are not yet optimal based on `number_of_review` & `reviews_per_month`
